Webcam controller motion based rhythm boxing game. Show your moves and burn some calories !!

This game utilizes the webcam video to detect punches using a machine learning based approach. The idea is to gamify a workout experience in a fun way. Throw left and right punches just as the scrolling colored balls enters the fixed circles. For best tracking align the panda's face at the same level of the circles. Make sure the punch goes above your shoulder. You may also wave up your hand and dance to the tune.
